                             CAHIR ON THE KEYBOARD

   THE WORK ON INTRO BEGUN ALMOST 1,5 YEARS AGO AS A TEACHING EXPERIMENT.
 THANKS TO COURTESY OF COMPUTER SCIENCE DEPARTMENT / UNIVERSITY OF WROCLAW
  I GAVE A COURSE IN AMIGA DEMOSCENE PROGRAMMING. A FEW FOLKS HAS ATTENDED
      AND TO MY SURPRISE THREE WERE INTERESTED IN LONG-TERM COOPERATION.
  AS THE RESULT GHOSTOWN GAINED NEW MEMBERS - AND MORE IMPORTANTLY - CODERS!
 THIS PRODUCTION IS THEIR FIRST RELEASE ON DEMOSCENE. WELCOME SPOOK AND KRIS!

YOU WANT NEW PEOPLE CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEMOSCENE? THEN TEACH THEM HOW TO DO SO!

AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST, THANK YOU ALICE FOR YOUR SUPPORT DURING THIS JOURNEY <3
